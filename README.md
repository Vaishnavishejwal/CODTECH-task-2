*Objective-

Allow Input of Grades- The program should accept input for various subjects or assignments from the user.

Calculate Average Grade- The program will compute the average grade based on the entered values.

Display Overall Grade- The program will display the computed average grade along with the corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C).

Additional Information- The program should calculate the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on a predefined grading scale, and show the overall grade summary.

*Key Activities-

Allow User to Input Grades-The program should accept input from the user for different subjects or assignments.It should handle both numerical grades (e.g., percentages) and optionally letter grades (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). 

Calculate Average Grade-After receiving the grades, the program should calculate the average score for all subjects or assignments.

Display Overall Grade-The program will display the average grade and then map that average to a letter grade or GPA scale.The GPA could be computed based on a standard scale.

Display Additional Information-The program will show the GPA, the letter grade, and optionally a summary of the grades entered by the user.

*Technologies Used-

Java (JDK 22)- For writing and compiling the Java code.

Scanner class- To take user input for grades.

Array or ArrayList-To store the grades.

Mathematical calculations- To compute the average, letter grade, and GPA.

*Key Insights-

Input Grades-The program allows the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments.

Average Grade Calculation- It will calculate the average grade based on the grades entered.

Letter Grade- The program will convert the numeric average into a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C).

GPA Calculation- If desired, it can also calculate the GPA based on a scale (e.g., 4.0 scale).

Data Validation- The program should ensure that grades entered are within valid ranges.

Interactive and User-Friendly- The program should prompt the user to enter grades for different subjects, calculate, and display results.
