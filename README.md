*Overview of the Project

*Project-Student Grade Tracker
*Objective-
Allow Input of Grades: The program should accept input for various subjects or assignments from the user.
Calculate Average Grade: The program will compute the average grade based on the entered values.
Display Overall Grade: The program will display the computed average grade along with the corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C).
Additional Information: The program should calculate the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on a predefined grading scale, and show the overall grade summary.
*Key Activities-
Allow User to Input Grades
The program should accept input from the user for different subjects or assignments.
It should handle both numerical grades (e.g., percentages) and optionally letter grades (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).
 Calculate Average Grade
After receiving the grades, the program should calculate the average score for all subjects or assignments.
Display Overall Grade
The program will display the average grade and then map that average to a letter grade or GPA scale.
The GPA could be computed based on a standard scale (e.g., 4.0 scale).
Display Additional Information
The program will show the GPA (if applicable), the letter grade, and optionally a summary of the grades entered by the user.
*Technologies Used-
Java (JDK 17): For writing and compiling the Java code.
Scanner class: To take user input for grades.
Array or ArrayList: To store the grades.
Mathematical calculations: To compute the average, letter grade, and GPA.
